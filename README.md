  - **IMPORTANT** Due to bugs in the chrome extension I am using, LeetSync, the problem numbers are **incorrect**, use the name of the problem instead.
- **Solutions Format:** Each folder includes:
  - A Markdown file with the full problem statement
  - My code for the solution (generally in **Python**)
    
## Why This Repository?
 - Documentation of Progress: Track my progress through LeetCode problems.
 - Reference for Future: Serve as a personal reference for problem-solving techniques.
 - Sharing Knowledge: Share approaches and solutions with others in the coding community.
